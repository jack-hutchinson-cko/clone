title: Sender data for Card Payouts
---

If you're sending a card payout on behalf of another person (a money transfer),
or a business/government entity (a third-party funds disbursement),
you must include the details of that person or entity in the `processing.senderInformation`
object in your payout request. You can see example payout requests with sender data on our [Card Payouts page](https://docs.checkout.com/preview/drafts/abc/card-payouts).

## Request a card payment

### The POST request

Card tokens (`tok_`) are single use and only have a 15-minute lifespan.
Once youve successfully sent your request, youll receive a response containing a
permanent card source ID (`src_`) which can be used in subsequent payment requests.

Use the approved field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful,
it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.
