title: Make a payout
account: NAS
---

`Full` account types can make on-demand payouts directly to the sub-entity's local bank account.

Once you've successfully processed a payment on behalf of the sub-entity, you will have funds that need to be paid out to them. You will also want to collect your platform fees.

On this page, we will walk through the how to pay out to a sub-entity:

- Retrieve currency account balance
- Store sub-entity bank account details
- Make a payout
- Collect platform fees

---

### Retrieve currency account balance

We are currently working on exposing real-time currency account balances through an API, and hope to offer this functionality soon.

In the meantime, you can [process balance](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports) reports to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) on a daily basis. If youâ€™d like to reconcile transactions for each sub-entity, you can process daily [financial actions](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports) reports to retrieve this breakdown.

---

### Create sub-entity payment instrument

A payment instrument is a set of bank account details securely stored in our vault. Creating an instrument is more secure because it means you don't need to keep entering bank details every time you make a payout.

You need to create a payment instrument so that it can be used as a destination payment when making on-demand payouts directly to your sub-entities.

There are different requirements to include in your request depending on the currency of the bank account. At the moment, you can just send money from the **UK**, but you can make a payout to UK bank accounts and European bank accounts.

You can see the full explanation of the optional fields in our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Instruments). For a UK bank, you must include: 

<Table>

A short description of what the instrument is for.

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
<TableRow>

### Make sub-entity payouts

Our Unified Payments API already enables you to make payouts to a sub-entity using the payments endpoint.

Making a payout is very similar to a payment, but there are a few more <StatusTag type="required" display="inline" /> fields. For a list of all possible fields you can include in a payout, see our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#operation/requestAPaymentOrPayout). Make sure you select _PayoutRequest_ to see the correct fields.

For a full walkthough, follow the instructions for our [payments endpoint](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment), and make sure you include the following fields.

### Collect platform fees

You collect your platform fees through the same method as making payouts to your sub-entities. The only difference is the `destination.id` field should be your Platform's payment instrument ID. This will have been provided to you during your onboarding with [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/).

#### Request example

```json
{
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "source": {
    "type": "currency_account",
    "id": "ca_e6myfp3ubs3ulk5tve6xx6x2oy"
  },
  "destination": {
    "type": "id",
    "id": "src_otruwzxbhvhutpoheg4q5jmkgq"
  },
  "billing_descriptor": {
    "reference": "Desserts Checkout Fees"
  },
  "processing_channel_id": "pc_q4dbxom5jbgudnjzjpz7j2z6uq",
