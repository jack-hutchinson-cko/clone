Frames is an iframe that handles payment information, so you remain PCI-compliant. Your customer inputs their card details directly into our iframes, then we send you a token representing those details, so you can request a payment.

## Who is Frames for?

Use Frames to generate a secure token to begin accepting card payments:

In parallel with your existing online integration as another way to reach your customers.

## How it works

1. You embed the Frames payment form in your website.
2. Your customer enters payment details directly on your checkout page.
3. We process your customer's sensitive information and return a token representing those details. This process is called tokenization.
4. You use the card token to [make a payment request](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment).

## What is tokenization?

Tokenization refers to the process of collecting sensitive payment information directly and returning a short-term, single-use token that represents this information. During this process, we handle the sensitive payment information, so responsibility for PCI compliance remains with us. You then use that token to request a payment using our [Unified Payments API](/payments).

We can tokenize cards, and [GooglePay](/payments/payment-methods/google-pay) and [ApplePay](/payments/payment-methods/apple-pay).

## Try it out

Use one of our [test cards](/testing/test-cards) and corresponding CVV to try Frames out for yourself. For example `4242 4242 4242 4242` with CVV `100`.

You can use any expiry date (`mm/yy`), as long as it's in the future.
