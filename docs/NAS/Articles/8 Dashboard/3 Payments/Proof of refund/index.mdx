Generate a Proof of Refund PDF directly from the _Payment details_ page, so you can send this to your customers as proof that a refund has been initiated.

Users with the [Manage payment documents](/dashboard/team-permissions) permission will be able to see _Refund PDF_ at the top of the _Payment details_ page on payments that have been refunded or partially refunded.

Once selected, you will receive a PDF download that contains the information your customer requires to trace the refund.

The Proof of Refund PDF contains two sections:
* Refund information, which includes the data and amount of the original charge.
* Account holder information, which includes the billing information when present on the payment.

## Multiple partial refunds

Where a payment has multiple partial refunds, selecting _Refund PDFs_ at the top of the screen will generate a zip folder that contains individual PDFs for each partial refund present on the payment.

You are also able to generate a PDF for a specific partial refund by selecting _Refund PDF_ directly on the partial refund event on the payment timeline.
