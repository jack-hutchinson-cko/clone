Once you have been onboarded to our Marketplaces solution, you are able to view your sub-entities' details and capabilities through the Dashboard, as well as check the status of their onboarding.

<TipBox>

Use these guides to support your learning:

- [The Dashboard at glance](/dashboard/the-dashboard-at-a-glance)
- [Marketplaces documentation](/marketplaces)

</TipBox>

### Before you begin

- Make sure your [user has permission](/dashboard/user-roles-and-management) to view sub-entities by being assigned one of the roles: owner, administrator, support manager, disputes manager and read only.
- Make sure your user has access to a legal entity that has been configured to onboard sub-entities.

### View sub-entities

You will see _Sub-entities_ on the left-hand navigation once you log into Dashboard.

Once you select _Sub-entities_, you will see: 

- Sub-entity trading name.
- [Status](/marketplaces/about-onboarding) of the sub-entity.
- Last modified date and time.

If you need additional information about the status of the sub-entity, hover over status for a brief explanation.

The information displayed here reflects the actions made with the Marketplace API during your integration with Checkout.com. For a reminder about when payment capabilities change, see our [onboarding pagea](/marketplaces/about-onboarding).

There are different sub-entity views depending on how much you want to drill down into your client-entities.

<tabs>
<tab title='Top-level account view'>
<Box horizontal='sm'>

1. Select the top-level account from the business entity selector on the top-left of the screen.
2. The sub-entity table will display all sub-entities under your account. If you have access to multiple entities who can onboard sub-entities, you will see all the sub-entities here.

</Box>
</tab>
<tab title='Legal entity view'>
<Box horizontal='sm'>

1. Select the legal entity from the business entity selector on the top-left of the screen.
2. The sub-entity table will display **only** the sub-entities under that legal entity.

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/View_your_sub-entities/only_legal_sub_entities.png)

</Box>
</tab>
<tab title='Legal entity not using Marketplaces view'>
<Box horizontal='sm'>

If one of your legal entities hasn’t been set up to onboard sub-entities, you will see the screen message: ‘This entity isn’t using Marketplaces yet’.

### Sub-entity search and filter

At both the top-level and legal entity view, you are able to search and filter through your sub-entities using the search bar. 

Upon entering the search bar, you are presented with options in a very similar way to the existing [payments filter and search functionality](/dashboard/track-and-manage-payments/filter-payments).
