This page describes the final steps you need to take as an Okta administrator in order to configure SSO for Checkout.com.

---

## Step 1: Finalize the SAML settings

1. Go to the Checkout.com SAML application you previously created.
2. Click _General > SAML Settings > Edit > Next_.
3. Replace the placeholder values for the Single Sign-On URL and the Audience URI with the parameters we previously shared with you.
4. Click _Next_, then _Finish_.

## Step 2: Assign the Checkout.com application to users

1. Go back to the Checkout.com application and click _Assignments > Assign to Groups_.
2. Assign the groups defined in the previous steps to the application.

## Step 3: Test the two types of login

---

## To test the Okta end-user dashboard (IDP-initiated login):

1. While logged in as a permitted user, check that a Checkout.com application is visible on the corporate Okta dashboard.
2. Click on the application. If everything is working correctly, it should authenticate you and redirect you to Checkout.com.

## To test the Checkout.com login page (SP-initiated login):

1. Go to either:
    - [https://dashboard.checkout.com](https://dashboard.checkout.com) (production)
    - [https://dashboard.sandbox.checkout.com](https://dashboard.sandbox.checkout.com) (sandbox)
2. Complete the email address field, then click _Next_. A Single-Sign On button is displayed.
3. Click on it. If everything is working correctly, it should redirect to Checkout.com.
