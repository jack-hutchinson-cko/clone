Disputes (also known as chargebacks) are a challenging but inevitable part of e-commerce. They arise when a customer queries a transaction with their card issuer. The issuer creates a formal dispute which immediately reverses the payment, debiting your account for both the payment amount and a dispute fee.

The Dashboard allows you to monitor and respond to disputes quickly and easily.

<TipBox>

This page explains how to manage disputes in the Dashboard, but you can also use our [Disputes API](/risk-management/disputes/disputes-api).

## View disputes

### In the Disputes screen

The Disputes screen contains two tabs:

- _Unanswered_: This tab contains all disputed payments for which an action is required.
- _All disputes_: This tab contains all payments that have been disputed, including unanswered ones.

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/disputes_screen.png)

Each tab shows the following information:

- Disputed amount
- Currency (as a 3-letter ISO code)
- Status (see above for more information)
- Reason for the dispute
- Payment ID
- Reference
- Initiated on
- Expiry date (in the Unanswered tab)
- Date last updated (in the All disputes tab)

<TipBox>

In the _All disputes_ tab, you can:

- filter by date range based on the Updated on date
- filter by _Payment ID_, _Dispute ID_, _Sub-entity ID_, _ARN_, _Reference_ (exact match)

</TipBox>

### In the *Payments* screen

In the _Status_ column, disputed payments have a `DISPUTED` label as well as the dispute's current status (for example, `DISPUTED EVIDENCE REQUIRED`).

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/disputes_payments_screen.png)

If a customer has made a retrieval request (meaning their bank has asked you for details of the transaction to validate it), the relevant payment will have a `RETRIEVAL REQUESTED` label.

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/retrieval_request.png)

If you have a payment with a retrieval request against it, you can contact our Disputes team at [disputes@checkout.com](mailto:disputes@checkout.com) to respond to it, or you can refund the payment directly from your Dashboard to avoid a chargeback.

<TipBox>

You can search for a dispute using its payment ID, dispute ID, or any other filter relevant in the page, such as a reference or the customer's email.

## View payment details

Select any disputed payment in the _Disputes_ or _Payments_ screens to bring up the payment details. You can view the dispute details, as well as the latest status of the payment.

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/dispute_payment_details.png)

## Respond to a dispute

If a dispute has the status `EVIDENCE REQUIRED`, you can respond by either accepting it or challenging it and submitting evidence. You can see how long you've got left to respond to any dispute by looking under the _Expires in_ column in the Unanswered tab.

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/unanswered_tab.png)

### Accept or challenge a dispute

In the _Disputes_ screen, select a disputed payment to see the payment details. 

- _Accept_: If you think the dispute is legitimate, because, for example, you know the transaction is fraudulent, select _Accept dispute_. You don’t have to do anything else; the funds will already have been debited from your account.
- _Challenge_: If you want to defend against the dispute, because you have evidence that the transaction is valid, select _Submit evidence_. This will take you to the [disputes form where you can upload your evidence](/dashboard/manage-disputes#Managedisputes-submitevidence).

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/dispute_details.png)

<TipBox variant='info'>

If a payment has multiple disputes raised against it, you will be asked to select the ID of the particular dispute you want to answer. Make sure you are submitting evidence to the right dispute.

</TipBox>

### Submit evidence

The evidence you submit should be relevant to the reason for the dispute. To help, we outline the recommended evidence for the particular dispute you’re responding to. Alternatively, select _General_ to see all the evidence types you can upload.

![title](/NAS/Dashboard/Manage_disputes/submit_evidence_form.png)

To submit your evidence:

1. Upload your files (JPEG, PDF or PNG).
2. For each file you upload, select what type of evidence it is.
3. If at any point you want to save your progress and come back to the form later, select _Save and continue later_. You, or another user, can then pick up where you left off. The dispute status will remain `EVIDENCE REQUIRED`.
4. If you’ve uploaded all the evidence you want to, select _Submit evidence_.

<TipBox variant='info'>

You can only upload **one file per type of evidence**, but you don’t have to submit every evidence type to complete the form.

</TipBox>

Once you’ve submitted your evidence, the form will be sent for review and the dispute’s status will change to `EVIDENCE UNDER REVIEW`. You can track its status in the All disputes tab of the Disputes page.
