<FAQItem title="How do I check the status of a payment?" popularity={21}>

If you want to check the status of a payment on the Hub, log in to your account and then go to the Payments screen, where you'll find the full payment activity for your business. Read our guide on [managing payments from the Hub](/the-hub/manage-hub-payments) for more details.

Alternatively, use the [get payment details endpoint](https://docs.checkout.com/payments/manage-payments/get-payment-details) to check the status of a specific payment.
