Read about our integration methods below, then choose the one that best suits your needs.

<TipBox variant="success" title="Update your integration to support SCA">

As of 14 September 2019, the EU’s revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) requires merchants to apply Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to most online payments within Europe. To comply with these new requirements, merchants should adopt the next generation of authentication – [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](/risk-management/3d-secure) – which creates a smoother and more secure checkout flow. Our integrations fully support 3DS2 and SCA, and ensure that you only ask your customers for additional authentication when needed.

## Frames

Frames is a highly customizable payment form, which allows customers to enter their payment details directly on your checkout page or in your app. We process these and exchange them for a secure, single-use token. You can then use this token to request a payment, without having to process or store any sensitive information yourself.

Whether you're processing payments on desktop or on mobile, our software development kits give you the freedom to build your own custom integration. We'll still take care of the processing side of things, and return tokenized payment information to you.

## Full card details API

Unlike our other integration methods, the full card details API does not use card tokens. Instead, you process your customers' card details directly. If you are looking to have total control over the checkout experience, then the full card details API may be the option for you.
