`source.card_token`

<StatusTag type="optional" />
<TypeTag type="string" />
</TableCell>
<TableCell>

This token (an eight-digit token generated by the merchant) allows you to re-use card details for multiple payments. When a subsequent payment is initialized with the same card token, the customer will be presented with two options: pay with KFast (where they don't need to enter their card details again), or with KNET as usual.

If you include this in your request, `source.user_defined_field3` must be empty, because they share a KNET API field.

<= 255 characters. Alphanumeric characters and spaces only.

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`source.ptlf`

<StatusTag type="optional" />
<TypeTag type="string" />
</TableCell>
<TableCell>

This is an ID for merchant PTLF functionality tracking. The value will appear on the bank statement.

If you include this in your request, `source.user_defined_field5` must be empty, because they share a KNET API field.

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
</TableBody>
</Table>

When sending a payment request that includes `source.card_token`, the option to pay via KFast is offered. If the token is new, the first payment will happen via the usual flow, but with the option to "register for KFast" before submitting. This flow is **not testable in the sandbox environment** because the registration for KFast requires the customer to enter a one-time password sent to the mobile phone number registered with the bank, which is not present in sandbox.

## Refund a payment

KNET supports full, partial and multiple partial refunds. Refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using our [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Before you can refund KNET payments, you need to contact your bank and ask them to enable refunds. Your bank will then send a request to KNET to activate the refund API.

---

## Cancel a payment

If, after landing on the KNET payment page, the customer attempts to complete the payment after seven minutes, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired` webhook.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.

---

## Testing KNET

<TipBox variant="info">

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate KNET payments in the sandbox environment.

</TipBox>

1.  Create a KNET transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to KNET's website.
2.  Enter the following details:
1.  **Select your bank**: Knet Test Card \[KNET1\]
2.  **Card number**:  `888888 000 000 000 1`
3.  **Expiration date**: `09 | 2021`
4.  **PIN**: `1234`
3.  Click **Submit** and then click **Confirm**. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
