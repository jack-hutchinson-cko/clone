## Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` linkâ€™s href in the response. The customer will be redirected to a Przelewy24 page where they can authorize the payment, before being transferred to your predefined success or failure URL.

---

## Get details about a payment

You can use the `payment_id` found in the payment response, or the `cko-session-id` from the success/failure URL (e.g., `https://www.checkout.com/order/succeeded?cko-session-id=sid_vii64oquze5u3h2x6hh4rurc4y`) to retrieve details about the payment.

<TipBox variant="note">

The `cko-session-id` expires 15 minutes after being created.
