<FAQItem title="How do I create a sandbox account?" popularity={20}>

You can create a sandbox account by clicking [here](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account).

With your sandbox account you can test card payments straight away. If you want to test alternative payment methods, or test payments that use raw card details (assuming you have SAQ-D PCI compliance), please contact our Integration team at [integration@checkout.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=integration@checkout.com).
