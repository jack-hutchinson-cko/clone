    }

## Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will send them to a Giropay bank selection page where they will select their bank before being transferred to that bank's page to enter their authorization details. If successful, the payment can be approved.

Once they've completed this step, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of a Giropay payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

## Refund a payment

Giropay supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or using the [refund API](/payments/manage-payments/refund-a-payment).

---

## Cancel a payment

If the customer fails to complete their payment, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired webhook`.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.
