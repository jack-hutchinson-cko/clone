## Overview

Poli payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request a payment](/payments/payment-methods/bank-transfers/poli#Request_a_payment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](/payments/payment-methods/bank-transfers/poli#Redirect_the_customer)

### Request example

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "poli"
      },
      "amount": 111,
      "currency": "AUD"
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info">

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

</TipBox>

### Response example

If a payment `id` is returned, then your request was successful.

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_nlj7cdwepelutidihyaeexyzae",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_qsbi7c2lnkbu5dhkkaci76xdh4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_nlj7cdwepelutidihyaeexyzae"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/109457"
        }
      }
    }
```

## Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` linkâ€™s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of a Poli payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

## Cancel a payment

If the customer cancels or fails to complete the transaction at any point after the payment is created, it will automatically be voided, and we'll send you a `payment_voided` webhook.
