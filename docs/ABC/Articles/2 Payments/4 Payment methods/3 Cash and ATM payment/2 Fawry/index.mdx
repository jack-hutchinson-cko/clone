Start accepting payments using Fawry, the dominant payment method in Egypt.

<TipBox>

Shoppers can now make Fawry payments via the myFawry app ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/myfawry/id1462911630?l=en) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fawry.myfawry&hl=en&gl=US)), rather than having to take their payment reference to a shop or ATM, meaning a better payment experience for both you and your customers.

</TipBox>

<TipBox variant="info">

To start accepting Fawry payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

### Request example

```json
    {
      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "EGP",
      "source": {
        "type": "fawry",
        "description": "Fawry Demo Payment",
        "customer_mobile": "01058375055",
        "customer_email": "bruce@wayne-enterprises.com",
        "products": [
          {
            "product_id": "0123456789",
            "quantity": 1,
            "price": 1000,
            "description": "Fawry Demo Product"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
```

### Response example

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

In addition, you will receive `payment_pending` and `payment_capture_pending` webhook notifications. And, when the customer completes the Fawry payment in a timely manner at a point of sale, you will get a `payment_captured` webhook notification to confirm that the payment has completed.

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_v65kd7q5tojehd23eftbaiktru"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy"
        }
      }
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info" title="Payment capture, expiration and cancellation">

The payment will remain pending for the duration that you agreed when you onboarded your business with Fawry, or until the date and time you set for `expires_on`. If the customer fails to complete the transaction at a point of sale by then, the payment will expire and you will receive a `payment_expired` webhook notification. If, for any reason, the payment gets canceled before being captured or expiring, you will receive the `payment_canceled` webhook notification instead. Make sure that your products and/or services are not shipped and/or provided before receiving confirmation of the capture.

## Refund a payment

Fawry supports both partial (see note below for details) and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using the [refund API](/payments/manage-payments/refund-a-payment).

<TipBox variant="note">

Only **one refund action** may be taken on a Fawry payment, meaning that if you carry out a partial refund, you cannot then refund any more, even if there is some amount left. In addition, Fawry **refunds are always rounded down** to the nearest whole number. For example, attempting to refund a payment amount of 10999 (EGP 109.99) will only refund 10900 (EGP 109.00).
