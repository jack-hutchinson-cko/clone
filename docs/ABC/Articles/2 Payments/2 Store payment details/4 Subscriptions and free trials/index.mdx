There are requirements set by the card networks when cardholders are offered subscriptions and free trial periods. The aim of these is to promote an enhanced and transparent customer experience.

If you do offer subscriptions, you will need to comply with the following requirements:

## 1. Consent

The cardholder has to expressly consent to sign up for the subscription and payment

## 2. Notification

When signing up for the subscription, cardholders must receive terms and conditions which must include: start date, details of goods or services, transaction amount, billing frequency and date, and a mechanism to cancel

## 3. Reminder Notification

For trial periods, cardholder must be notified at least 7 days before a trial or introductory offer will end, and be given the option to cancel

## 4. Transaction Receipts or Confirmation

The transaction amount, transaction date for initial and subsequent transactions, and instructions on how to cancel. If a trial period, this must include the length of the trial or introductory offer, and clearly state that following the trial, the cardholder will be charged unless the subscription is cancelled

## 5. Statement Descriptor

A descriptor indicating a trial-period-related transaction is recommended in the _Merchant Name_ field for the first financial transaction at the end of a trial period, for example “end trial”. You can [read more about dynamic descriptors](/resources/dynamic-billing-descriptor)

## 6. Cancellation

Cardholders must have an easy way to cancel a subscription and this must be disclosed when signing up for the subscription
