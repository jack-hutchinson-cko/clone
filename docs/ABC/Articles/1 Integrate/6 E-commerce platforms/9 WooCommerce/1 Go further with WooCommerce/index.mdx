## Accept recurring payments via the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension

Recurring payments allows you to enable shopper interactions for scheduled payments like subscription payments.

<TipBox variant="note">

To be able to use this feature, you must be using WooCommerce Subscriptions to manage subscriptions within WooCommerce. See [WooCommerce Subscriptions Store Manager Guide](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/store-manager-guide/#section-1).

</TipBox>

The [Checkout.com](http://Checkout.com) WooCommerce plugin registers with payment events triggered by [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?quid=5e8af87e904d140455ce35c27943f7ce) to support the following actions:

- Cancellation of a subscription
- Suspension of a subscription
- Re-activation of a subscription
- Change of amount for a subscription
- Change of date for a subscription
- Management of multiple subscriptions

These settings allow you to edit the order statuses in line with the status of the payment. They are automatically set to WooCommerce's default values, so be aware that editing them may cause problems with the order flow.

To find these settings:

1. Log into your Wordpress admin dashboard.
2. Go to *WooCommerce > Settings > Payments*.
3. Find the Checkout.com plugin.
4. Select *Manage* and then *Order Settings*.
