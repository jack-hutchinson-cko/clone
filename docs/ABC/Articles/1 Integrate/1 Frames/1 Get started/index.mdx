This page explains what you need to get up and running with Frames.

---

## Before you begin

- Make sure you have your `public_key`. You can find it in the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com" target="_blank">Hub</ExternalLink>, under _Settings > Channels_. If you don't have an account with us yet, you can <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" target="_blank">create a free test account now</ExternalLink> to practise API calls, and use the sandbox version of the endpoint.
- You can set up [webhooks](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks) to be notified when the payment has been approved, so you can continue the sales fulfilment flow.

<TipBox variant="warning">

Use your public key on the client side. You should never include your secret key on the client side for security reasons. Only use the secret key on the server side.

</TipBox>

## Access Frames

To get started using Frames, you first need to get access to its built-in features. On this page, we will reference tags suitable for HTML webpages. See our <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/checkout/frames-react" target="_blank">Frames React wrapper</ExternalLink> for an alternative option.

Include the CDN package in a script tag on your relevant HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.checkout.com/js/framesv2.min.js"></script>
```

## Choose single or multiple iframes

Frames can be rendered either as a single iframe (displayed as one input field) or as multiple iframes (displayed as multiple input fields).

We insert an iframe between each placeholder `div` you put in your payment form.

<tabs>
<tab title="Single iframe">

We will insert a single iframe in:

```html
<div class="card-frame">
    <!-- form will be added here -->
</div>
```

<Box horizontal="sm" align="center">
  <Iframe
      src="https://assets.checkout.com/docs/examples/1liner-new/index.html"
      height="250"
      width="350"
    />
</Box>

<Box horizontal="sm" align="center">
  <ButtonLink href="https://assets.checkout.com/docs/downloads/single_iframe_new.zip">
      Download sample files (.zip)
    </ButtonLink>
</Box>

</tab>
<tab title="Multiple iframes">

We insert iframes in the following containers:

```html
<div class="card-number-frame">
  <!-- card number will be added here -->
</div>
<div class="expiry-date-frame">
  <!-- expiry date will be added here -->
</div>
<div class="cvv-frame">
  <!-- cvv frame will be added here -->
</div>
```

<Box horizontal="sm" align="center">
  <Iframe
    src="https://assets.checkout.com/docs/examples/wireframe-new/index.html"
    height="375"
    width="350"
  />
</Box>

<Box horizontal="sm" align="center">
  <ButtonLink href="https://assets.checkout.com/docs/downloads/multi_iframes_new.zip">
    Download sample files (.zip)
  </ButtonLink>
</Box>

</tab>
</tabs>

---

## Initialize Frames

Before the input fields appear on your website and app, you need to initialize Frames.

In your JavaScript file, call the init (short for initialize) action on the Frames object and include your public API key within the brackets.

```javascript
Frames.init("pk_test_XXXX");
```

---

## Set up Frames events

Frames has a collection of events that are triggered when certain actions happen. This is how your application will know when a form has been submitted, or card details tokenized. They also help you tailor the experience you want to provide to your customers.

We have listed all [required configuration options](/integrate/frames/frames-reference#Events).
