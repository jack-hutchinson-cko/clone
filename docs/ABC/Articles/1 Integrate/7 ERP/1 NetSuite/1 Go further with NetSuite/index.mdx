## Customer deposits and bank reconciliation


This section describes how to perform bank reconciliation using customer deposits in NetSuite.

1. Sign in to your [Hub](/the-hub) account and select _Payments > Create payment_.
2. If you have multiple businesses, select the appropriate one from the drop-down.
3. Select a channel.
4. Enter the customer's email address.
5. Add the payment and card details.
6. Select _Create payment_ to confirm. After refreshing the Hub instance, the newly created payment is displayed on the _Payments_ screen.

<TipBox variant="info">

Any new Customer records in NetSuite are mapped according to _Customer email_ and _Cardholder name_. If there is an existing Customer record in NetSuite associated with the provided email address or cardholder name, payment records will be mapped to that Customer record.

</TipBox>

7. Sign in to your NetSuite account and search the Customer record by name or email address.
8. In the Customer record, select _Sales > Transactions_ to view the customer deposit details. The amount and currency shown here correspond to the amount and currency entered when creating the payment in the Hub. 
9. Select the date under _Sales > Transactions_ to open the Customer Deposit record. The Customer Deposit is associated with the newly created Customer record, the respective general ledger (GL) account, and the Checkout.com payment method. Under Payment Method > Payment Events, you can see the Customer Deposit details.
10. To complete the bank reconciliation process, select _Transactions > Bank > Match Bank Data_.
11. Select the relevant _Account_ and filter transactions by today’s date to locate the corresponding Customer Deposit.

## Invoice order-to-cash and refund process

### Creating an invoice

1. To open a blank Invoice form that isn’t linked to any specific Customer record, select _Transactions > Sales > Create Invoices_.

Alternatively, you can create an invoice directly from a Customer record by selecting _Invoice_ from the _Create New_ menu. This opens an Invoice form prepopulated with that customer’s recorded details, such as their name, account information and billing address.

2. On the Invoice form, complete the required fields, as well as the desired items and their respective quantities.
3. Select _Save_. This generates the Checkout.com Payment Link URL in the _Custom_ tab. The link leads to the Checkout.com Hosted Payments Page for the customer to complete the purchase. If the payment is successful, the customer is taken to the hosted Checkout.com confirmation page.

When the payment is successfully completed, it’s reflected on the _Payments_ screen in the Hub. In addition, the webhook updates the invoice status in NetSuite to `Paid in full`, which is reflected after refreshing the NetSuite instance. In the _Related Records_ tab, a payment record with a `Not deposited` status appears – this indicates that the payment is successful, but the funds haven’t yet been deposited. 

4. To view the corresponding customer payment, select the date in the _Related Records_ tab in the Invoice record. This opens the Payment record, which is associated with the account for undeposited funds.

In the Invoice record, in the _System Information_ tab, you can view the payment information, such as the Checkout.com Payment Link, token response, Payment Link token, and link expiry date.

5. Since the funds are undeposited, you need to make the deposit by selecting _Transactions > Bank > Make Deposits_.

6. On the Deposit form, select the checkbox next to the relevant payment number(s) and select _Save_.  This generates a Deposit record for the selected payment(s).

### Processing a refund

1. Select _Authorize Return_ to start the native NetSuite Return Materials Authorization (RMA) process. This generates a Return Authorization form. 
2. In the _Billing_ tab, the _Bill To_ field is auto-populated with the customer's default billing address. You can change this address if needed. 
3. Save the Return Authorization form and complete the native RMA process.
4. Select _Refund_ on the Return Authorization form. This generates a Credit Memo form. You can view the Payment Link token in the _Billing_ tab.
5. Save the Credit Memo form.
6. Select _Refund_ to proceed. This generates a Customer Refund form.
7. Save the Customer Refund form. 
8. Select _Checkout Refund_. This submits the refund process directly to Checkout.com and distributes the funds back to the customer via the webhook.

## Sales order processing with card transactions

1. To open a blank Sales Order form that isn’t linked to any specific Customer record, select _Transactions > Sales > Enter Sales Orders_.

Alternatively, you can create a sales order directly from a Customer record by selecting _Sales Order_ from the _Create New_ menu. This opens a Sales Order form prepopulated with that customer’s recorded details, such as their name, account information and billing address.

2. On the Sales Order form, complete the required fields, as well as the desired items and their respective quantities. 
3. In the _Shipping_ tab, select _Calculate Shipping_ to add the shipping charges.
4. Under _Billing > Checkout.com_, you can use a saved payment card by selecting _List_ and choosing the desired card number. Alternatively, you can add new card details by selecting _Add Card_.
5. After completing the necessary fields, select _Save_. 

<TipBox variant="info">

When the Sales Order record is saved, you can review the Checkout.com payment method under _Billing > Checkout.com_. This payment method overrides the existing native NetSuite payment method.

</TipBox>

6. In the Sales Order record, select _Bill Remaining_. This creates a Cash Sale record with a `To Be Generated` status. You can view the payment details under _Billing > Checkout.com_. 
7. Select _Save_ to proceed. The saved Cash Sale record is now in status `Not Deposited`, and it’s associated with the account for undeposited funds.
8. Since the funds are undeposited, you need to make the deposit by selecting _Transactions > Bank > Make Deposits_.
9. On the Deposit form, select the checkbox next to the relevant payment number(s) and select _Save_. This creates a corresponding Deposit record for the selected Cash Sale record(s).
