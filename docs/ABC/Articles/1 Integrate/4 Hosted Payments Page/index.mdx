Hosted Payments Page is a Checkout.com-hosted webpage where you send your customers to finalize their payment details. Because we host the webpage, you never touch these secure details, so the responsibility for [PCI compliance](/risk-management/pci-compliance) remains with us.

<TipBox variant="info">

Hosted Payments Page now supports six more payment methods.

## How it works

Hosted Payments Page is completely hosted by Checkout.com. All you need to do is provide us with the payment information, and we will generate a link that will redirect customers to a Hosted Payments Page.

When your customer is ready to check out:

1. Request a Hosted Payments Page session and let us know all the payment information, like the amount, currency, country and reference.
2. We'll use this information to generate a link that you will use to direct your customer to a Hosted Payments Page with their product information displayed.
3. Once your customer fills in the required payment details, we will process the payment and handle the authentication flow.
4. After the payment has been successfully processed, you will be notified by a [webhook](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks).
