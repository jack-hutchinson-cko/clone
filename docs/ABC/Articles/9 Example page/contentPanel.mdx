<ContentPanel title="Frames" imgSrc="/docs/Collect payment/Frames.svg">

Frames is a highly customizable payment form, which allows customers to enter their payment
details directly on your checkout page or in your app. We process these and exchange them for a
secure, single-use token. You can then use this token to request a payment, without having to
process or store any sensitive information yourself.

We'll still take care of the processing side of things, and return tokenized payment information to you.

<ContentPanel title="Full card details API" imgSrc="/docs/Collect payment/FullСard.svg">

Unlike our other integration methods, the full card details API does not use card tokens. Instead, you process your customers' card details directly. If you are looking to have total control over the checkout experience, then the full card details API may be the option for you.
