If you're sending a card payout on behalf of another person (a money transfer),
or a business/government entity (a third-party funds disbursement),
you must include the details of that person or entity in the `processing.senderInformation`
object in your payout request. You can see example payout requests with sender data on our [Card Payouts page](https://docs.checkout.com/preview/drafts/abc/card-payouts).
